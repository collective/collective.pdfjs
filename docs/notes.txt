put all the needed stuff in the resources directory:
    the images folder where the needed pics are in
    the l10n.js for translation
    the locale.properties file
    and the compatibility.js for browser support
    and the integration.js to make it look nice in plone


adjusted css and jsregistry under profiles

in the configure zcml also adjusted the resourcedirectory

in the pdfjs_file_view.pt added a headslot and filled it with locale.properties

then in the pagetemplate copied the structure from the original mozillapdfjs 

in viewer.js added the PDFJS.workerSrc to "++resource++collective.pdfjs.resources/pdf.js";

also added on line 2674: if (jQuery("#outerContainer").length == 0) {return};
to only load on demand and on pdf (not every plone item)
