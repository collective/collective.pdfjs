collective.pdfjs Installation
=============================

zc.buildout
-----------
If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``collective.pdfjs`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.pdfjs
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.pdfjs
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
